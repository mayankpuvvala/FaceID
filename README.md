## About
Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning project! In this project, I've developed a real-time face recognition system using deep learning techniques and the Dlib library. This project is part of my journey to become proficient in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Key Features
- Real-time face recognition from your laptop's camera.
- Capture and store known face descriptors.
- Recognize and label known faces.
- Fun and educational project to enhance your machine learning skills.

## Technologies Used
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Dlib](http://dlib.net/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
