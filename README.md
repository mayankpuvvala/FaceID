## About
Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning project! In this project, I've developed a real-time face recognition system using deep learning techniques and the Dlib library. This project is part of my journey to become proficient in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Key Features
- Real-time face recognition from your laptop's camera.
- Capture and store known face descriptors.
- Recognize and label known faces.
- Fun and educational project to enhance your machine learning skills.

## Technologies Used
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Dlib](http://dlib.net/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [MIT License](LICENSE)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install dlib opencv-python numpy
   ```

3. Download the necessary shape predictor and recognition model files:
   - [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)
   - [dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat](http://dlib.net/files/dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat.bz2)

4. Extract the downloaded files and place them in the project directory.

## Usage
- Run the script `face_recognition.py` to start the real-time face recognition system.
- Capture known faces by pressing the 'c' key.
- Press the 'Esc' key to exit.
